# SB_INF_STAT_HOSPREADMIS
This repo contains the code with solution for exercise given for Inferential statistics. This is part of Springboard DS career track course.
</br></br>
<b>Task Description </b></br></br>
In this exercise, you will:
<ol>
<ul>critique a preliminary analysis of readmissions data and recommendations (provided below) for reducing the readmissions rate</ul>
<ul>construct a statistically sound analysis and make recommendations of your own</ul>
</ol>
Instructions and data are provided in the attached Jupyter notebook.
</br>
This contains a file with responses for all resume submitted observation in  cms_hospital_readmissions.csv. This file contains 13666 independent response. The data was divided in white sonding and black sounding name and the call back response</br></br>

Using data in file 'data/cms_hospital_readmissions.csv' following needs to find out.</br>

<p>Include your work on the following <strong>in this notebook and submit to your Github account</strong>. </p>
<p>A. Do you agree with the above analysis and recommendations? Why or why not?</p>
<p>B. Provide support for your arguments and your own recommendations with a statistically sound analysis:</p>
<ol>
<li>Setup an appropriate hypothesis test.</li>
<li>Compute and report the observed significance value (or p-value).</li>
<li>Report statistical significance for α=.01. </li>
<li>Discuss statistical significance and practical significance. Do they differ here? How does this change your recommendation to the client?</li>
<li>Look at the scatterplot above. <ul>
<li>What are the advantages and disadvantages of using this plot to convey information?</li>
<li>Construct another plot that conveys the same information in a more direct manner.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<b>The task contains following steps.</b></br>
1.	Reading data provided from dta file. </br>
2.	Create data frame for the data</br>
3.	Apply the infenertial statiscs skills to get answers</br>
